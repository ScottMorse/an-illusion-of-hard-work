GitHub doesn't display commits to private repositories.

This repository runs a scheduled job that creates commits to itself every day.

I do this because developers are judged based on their GitHub activity, but this activity only shows for public repositories. I don't agree with this judgement, because of both this fact and how easy it is to create worthless commits for show.

I have seen many developers advocate for committing to a public repository daily, purely for the sake of improving their green squares, regardless of the value of the work. I won't waste my own time making sure I have worthless commits in my profile. So, I automated it. Those that are fooled by this do not know how to judge developers in the first place, and those that aren't can take a look at my actual work rather than a meaningless activity metric.
