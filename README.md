GitHub doesn't display commits to private repositories.

This repository runs a scheduled job that creates commits to itself every day.

I do this because developers are judged based on their GitHub activity, but this activity only shows for public repositories. I don't agree with this judgement, precisely because of how easy it is to create worthless commits.

I have seen many developers advocate for committing to a public repository daily purely for the sake of improving their green squares. I also don't agree with wasting my own time making sure I have worthless commits in my profile. So, I automated it. Those that are fooled by this do not know how to judge developers in the first place, and those that aren't can take a look at my actual work rather than a meaningless activity metric.
