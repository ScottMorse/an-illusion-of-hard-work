# The Illusion of Hard Work

Because GitHub doesn't display commits to private repositories.

## What is this?

This repository runs a scheduled job that creates commits to itself every day.

This makes it look like I must be a hard-working developer to certain individuals, who want to see green squares on my GitHub profile.

## Why am I telling you this?

Unfortunately, before I created this repository, even when I was doing a lot of work, it was often not visible, because I most often commit to private repositories, either owned by my employers or myself.

I have open-source projects, but even with these, I will keep private repositories for internal use to keep the public repository clean.

I'm simply automating the process of making worthless commits to a public repository manually every day, as many engineering influencers popularly suggest to others on LinkedIn and such. I would rather spend my time doing my actual work.

I am confident in my own work, but I don't want someone who doesn't understand GitHub or people to be an irrational barrier to opportunity over these green squares.

If you have found yourself here, then I thank you for actually reviewing my profile.
